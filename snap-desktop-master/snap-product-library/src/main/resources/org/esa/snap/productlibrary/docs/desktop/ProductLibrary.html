<h3>Product Library</h3>

<p>The Product Library tool optimizes the
    identification of data products in a database for fast retrievable of
    the metadata of locally stored products. Search results are displayed
    in a table listing product name, path, mission, product type,
    acquisition date, pass, pixel spacing, etc. without actually opening
    the original products. The footprint of each image is outlined on the
    world map over top of Blue Marble images with a place names vector
    layer. Multilooked quicklooks of the images are also generated and
    stored in the database for quick previewing.</p>

<p>The Product Library
    can optionally automatically add new metadata to the database whenever
    a product is manually opened. The user may also define a list of
    repository folders that will be scanned recursively for new or modified
    products.</p>

<p>The product readers of the Toolbox are able to abstract
    the metadata from each product into the Generic Product Model of the
    Toolbox. Thereby, the Product Library and all processing tools of the
    Toolbox are able to work with the metadata in this common form without
    requiring the user to manually input any metadata.</p>

<p>Products may
    be searched in terms of mission, product type, beam mode, ground
    location, date and time of acquisition, processing history, previously
    defined AOIs, and suggested image pairing. Products may also be
    searched by graphically drawing an area of interest on the world map
    and querying the database for products that cover the AOI.</p>

<p>The
    user may then select from the resulting table of products which
    products to open, add to a project, or batch process directly from the
    Product Library.</p>

<h3>Importing into a Project</h3>

<p>After having selected the products
    you wish to import, press the Import to Project button to convert the
    products into DIMAP format and add them to the currently opened
    project. If a project is not currently opened you will be prompted to
    create a new project.</p>

<p>If you would like to simply open the
    products without converting them into DIMAP format then press the Open
    Selected button to add them to the DAT Product View list.</p>

<h3>Batch Processing</h3>

<p>To
    Batch Process a list of selected products press the Batch Process
    button. This will open the Batch Processing dialog and add your
    products to the input list. If you right click on the Batch Processing
    button, a popup menu will appear with all the&nbsp;graphs from the User
    Graphs menu. You may select one and then the Batch Processing dialog
    will default to the graph selected.</p>
