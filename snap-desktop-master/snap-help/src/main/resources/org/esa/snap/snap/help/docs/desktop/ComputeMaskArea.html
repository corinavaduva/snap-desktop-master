<h3>Compute Mask Area</h3>

<p>
    This command computes the are of a selected mask. The command is enabled when the active image view shows
    a product with at least one mask defined. When there is more than one mask defined for the product, a dialog
    pops up where a mask can be selected. The following results are computed:    
</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Number of mask pixels</b> - The number of pixels contained in the mask area.</li>
    <li><b>Mask area</b> - The computed area of the mask in km<sup>2</sup>.</li>
    <li><b>Mean pixel area</b> - The computed mean pixel area of the mask in km<sup>2</sup>.</li>
    <li><b>Minimum pixel area</b> - The computed minimum pixel area of the mask in km<sup>2</sup>.</li>
    <li><b>Maximum pixel area</b> - The computed maximum pixel area of the mask in km<sup>2</sup>.</li>
    <li><b>Mean earth radius</b> - The mean earth radius in km<sup>2</sup> on which the computation is based.</li>
</ul>
