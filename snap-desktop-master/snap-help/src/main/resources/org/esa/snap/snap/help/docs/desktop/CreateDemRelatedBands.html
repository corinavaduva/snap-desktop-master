<h3>Create DEM-related Bands</h3>

<p>
    This command adds a new DEM-elevation band and optionally DEM-corrected latitude and longitude bands to the current product. The
    bands are computed by looking up each pixel in a selected high-resolution DEM (which is by default
    <a href="GETASSE30ElevationModel.html">GETASSE30</a>).
    As opposed to the <a href="Orthorectification.html">orthorectification</a> tool, which always reprojects the data product,
    the DEM-corrected latitudes and longitudes are computed in the selected product's current coordinate system.
