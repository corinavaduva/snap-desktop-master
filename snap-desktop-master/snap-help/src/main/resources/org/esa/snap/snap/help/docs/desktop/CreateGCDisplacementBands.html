<h3>Create Geo-Coding Displacement Bands</h3>

<p>
    This command adds 4 bands to the currently selected product. These four bands provide information about the accuracy of the geo-coding.
    Note, that this doesn't mean the absolute accuracy of the geo-coordinates, but only the transformation from pixel positions to geo-coordinates and
    back. The four created bands are namely <i>gc_displ_x</i>, <i>gc_displ_y</i>, <i>gc_displ_ampl</i> and <i>gc_displ_phase</i>.
