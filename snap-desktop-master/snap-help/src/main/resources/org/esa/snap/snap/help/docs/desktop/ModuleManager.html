<h3>Module Manager Overview</h3>

<p><i>Modules</i> are an integral part of the Sentinel Toolbox architecture.
    A module is a versioned and updatable software component. The entire SNAP software is composed of
    exchangeable modules. A few SNAP modules provide system functionality such as software
    libraries and programming interfaces whilst others act as plug-ins which add extra
    functionality to the system, such as product data readers, writers and processors.
    <!-- todo - for information regarding the BEAM 4 architecture ... -->
</p>

<p>The module manager is used to inspect installed modules, install new modules, update and uninstall existing
    modules.
</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/ModuleManager.png" alt="Module Manager"></p>

<p>To inspect a module, select it in the <b>Installed Modules</b> tab and browse the information panel below
    the modules table.
    In order to install a new, uninstall or update an existing module, select the module first,
    then click the corresponding <b>Install</b>, <b>Update</b> or <b>Uninstall</b> action button
    above the modules table. This will assign the action to the module. You can also select multiple modules.
    By right-clicking the selected modules, a context menu with the available actions will pop up.
</p>

<p> If <b>Module Updates</b> or <b>Available Modules</b> tabs are selected the first time, the module manager
    will establish an internet connection to a remote module repository and download the available list of
    modules. The settings for the repository connection can be adjusted in the
    <a href="PreferencesDialog.html">Preferences Dialog</a>.
</p>

<p> The actions are not performed before the <b>OK</b> button is clicked. The module manager may detect
    that the current set of actions will lead to an inconsistent software state. This mainly happens if
    dependencies on modules exists which are scheduled for uninstallation. In this case an error message
    will be displayed and no action will be performed. All actions are performed in the background
    so that you can continue working with with the Sentinel Toolbox. If an error occurs during the execution of action (e.g.
    connection failure, I/O errors), a rollback will be performed and all changes will become undone.
</p>

<p class="inote">Note: All SNAP modules are stored in a directory named <code>modules</code> which is
    located in the SNAP installation directory. You can also manually install modules by copying a
    module file into the <code>modules</code> directory. Module files are usually named
    <code>&lt;name&gt;-&lt;version&gt;.jar</code>. Similar modules are uninstalled by removing the
    corresponding file from this directory.
    <!--If you observe difficulties by using the module manager (e.g. unsupported proxy settings)
    you may want to download modules from the BEAM home page using an internet browser
    and install/uinstall them without the module manager.--></p>

<h3>Module Manager Components</h3>

<p>
    <b>Install</b> button<br>
    <blockquote>
        Assigns the install action to all selected modules in the <b>Available Modules</b> tab.
    </blockquote>
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Update</b> button<br>
    <blockquote>
        Assigns the update action to all selected modules in the <b>Module Updates</b> tab and to

    </blockquote>
</p>

<p>
    <b>Uninstall</b> button<br>
    <blockquote>
        Assigns the uninstall action to all selected modules in the <b>Installed Modules</b> tab.

    </blockquote>
</p>

<p>
    <b>Clear</b> button<br>
    <blockquote>

<p>
    <b>Filter category</b> drop-down list<br>
    <blockquote>
        If a category is selected from this list, only modules belonging to that category will be shown
        in the module tables.
    </blockquote>
</p>

<p>
    <b>Installed Modules</b> tab<br>
    <blockquote>
        Displays all installed modules in a table.
    </blockquote>
</p>

<p>
    <b>Module Updates</b> tab<br>
    <blockquote>
        Displays all modules for which an update exists in the remote module repository.
        If not already done, selecting this tab will cause the module manager
        to synchronize the installed modules with the modules in the remote module repository.
    </blockquote>
</p>

<p>
    <b>Available Modules</b> tab<br>
    <blockquote>
        Displays all available modules of the remote module repository.
        If not already done, selecting this tab will cause the module manager
        to synchronize the installed modules with the modules in the remote module repository.
