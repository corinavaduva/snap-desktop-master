<p>This dialog lets you specify the position
    of the reference pixel and the easting and northing at this pixel of the output product. Also you are able to set
    the orientation angle and the pixel size. The orientation angle is the angle between geographic north and map grid
    north (in degrees), with other words, the convergence angle of the projection's vertical axis from true north.
    Easting and northing and also the pixel size are given in the units of the underlying map (e.g. dec. degree for
    geographic and meter for the UTM projection).
</p>

<p>In order to force a certain width and height in pixels for the output product, you must deselect the fit product
    size option. Otherwise the size is automatically adjusted, so that the entire source region is included in the new
    region.
