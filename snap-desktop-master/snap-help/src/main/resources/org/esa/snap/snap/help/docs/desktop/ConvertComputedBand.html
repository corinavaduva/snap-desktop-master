<h3>Convert Computed Band</h3>

<p>
    This command converts a computed band into a "real" band. Computed bands are virtual and filtered bands. In contrast to
    "real" bands their data is not stored but computed when necessary. The command is only active, if a virtual or filtered
    band is selected. It is also listed in the context menu of such a band.</p>
