<h4>Reopen&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/icons/History24.gif"></h4>

    an entry and the Toolbox will re-open the product.</p>

<h4>OPeNDAP Access&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/icons/RsProduct24.gif"></h4>

<p>An <a href="nbdocs://org.esa.snap.snap.opendap.ui/org/esa/snap/opendap/docs/opendapclient/Overview.html">OPeNDAP client</a> for accessing a OPeNDAP server is shown a new dialogue. The provided
    data products of the server can be downloaded to the hard disk and opened in the Sentinel Toolbox.</p>

<h4>Product Grabber&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/icons/RsProduct24.gif"></h4>

    importing
    reasons.</p>

<h4><a name="close">Close Product (Control-W)</a></h4>

<p>Closes the currently selected product. This commands is also available in the
    context menu when you right-click over the open product list.</p>

<h4><a name="openSession">Open Session (Control-Shift-O)</a></h4>

<p>Opens a SNAP <a href="Session.html">Session</a> file stored on the hard disk in the Sentinel Toolbox. A session is termed the
    collection of all products and image views open in the Sentinel Toolbox, including any layers added to a view. When a session
    file is opened, a previously saved session (see <a href="#saveSession">Save Session</a>) is restored.
    Note that all open products will be closed before a session file is opened.
</p>

<h4><a name="saveSession">Save Session (Control-Shift-S)</a></h4>

<p>Saves the current <a href="Session.html">Session</a> to the associated SNAP session file. If the current session is
    not associated with a SNAP session file, you are asked to specify a storage location for the session file.</p>

<h4>Save Session As</h4>

<p>Saves the current session to a new SNAP session file. You are asked to specify a storage location for the new
    session file.</p>

<h4><a name="closeSession">Close Session (Control-Shift-W)</a></h4>

<p>Closes all products and image views currently opened in the Sentinel Toolbox.
    Note that changes made during a session are not written to an associated SNAP <a href="Session.html">Session</a> file.
    In order to write the changes to a session file the session must be saved
    (see <a href="#saveSession">Save Session</a>) explicitly.</p>

    If the product still does not have a file location, then you are asked to specify a storage location for the
    product. Note that save process can be a time consuming process for huge products.</p>
