<h3>Application Overview</h3>

<p>The Sentinel Toolbox is a visualisation, analysing and processing application based on the Sentinel Application Platform, SNAP.
    It comes with a clear and intuitive user interface allowing new users to get started quickly.</p>

<p>The Sentinel Toolbox lets you switch between a <a href="ProductExplorer.html">Product Explorer</a> providing
    overview over multiple open products within a tree view and a comprehensive pixel information view to
    display geophysical values, interpolated tie-points and quality flags at the same time.</p>

<p>
    The <a href="ToolWindows.html#toolwindows">Tool Windows</a> of the Sentinel Toolbox provide access to tools, as the name says.
    These windows can be floating, docked or tabbed. This docking concept allows a tidy work space
    and you can arrange all tool windows as you like. All changes you apply to the layout will be saved for
    the next start of the Toolbox.
</p>

<p class="inote"><b>Note</b>: The open command is used to open any product format which is supported by SNAP, the
    save command stores data products in the <a href="../general/overview/BeamDimapFormat.html">BEAM-DIMAP format</a>.
    You can also import any data product by using the corresponding import-command in
    the <a href="FileMenu.html">File Menu</a> which allows to open a subset of a data product.
    For a list of supported ENVISAT products please refer to the
    <a href="../general/envisat-products/index.html">ENVISAT Product Tables</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A new <a href="ProductSceneView.html">Image View</a> is simply created by double-clicking on a tie-point grid or
    spectral/geophysical band.
    You can open as much images as your computer's RAM allows. After you have opened an
    <a href="ProductSceneView.html">Image View</a> you
    can inspect the images with the <a href="NavigationWindow.html">Navigation Window</a>.</p>

<h3>Quick Start with the Sentinel Toolbox</h3>

<p>
    After you have opened an <a href="ProductSceneView.html">Image View</a>
    you can modify the colors of the image using the
    <a href="ColorManipulationWindow.html">Colour Manipulation</a> window or overlay an opaque or semi-transparent data
    mask with the
    <a href="MaskManagement.html">Mask Manager</a>. Both tool windows
    operate in non-modal mode, which means they float over the main frame and you can place them
    somewhere on your desktop.</p>

<p>The following links will guide you through the main components of the graphical user interface:</p>

<blockquote>
    <a href="ProductExplorer.html">The Product Explorer</a><br>
    <a href="ToolWindows.html">The Tool Windows</a><br>
